**Define the Problem:**

You need to create a search string that helps find movie files using search engines by focusing on specific file types and excluding certain URLs. The search should include the movie title, target specific video file formats without using quotes, and apply exclusion filters.

**Prompt Priming:**

Start with the movie title and include additional search parameters to refine the search results. Use `intitle:"index of"` to narrow down to directory listings that typically have downloadable files.

**Employ Prompting Techniques:**

- **Step by Step:** Explain the components of the search string.
- **Modifiers:** Use precise modifiers to ensure accuracy.
- **Focused Prompt Frameworks:** Specify the use of logical operators and delimiters correctly.

**Desired Response Length:**

Keep the search string concise but comprehensive, ideally within a single paragraph.

**Provide Examples and Formatting:**

Here's an example of how the search string should be formatted:

```plaintext
[movie title] intitle:"index of" (3G2|3GP|3GP2|3GPP|AMR|AMV|ASF|AVI|BDMV|BIK|D2V|DIVX|DRC|DSA|DSM|DSS|DSV|EVO|F4V|FLC|FLI|FLIC|FLV|HDMOV|IFO|IVF|M1V|M2P|M2T|M2TS|M2V|M4B|M4P|M4V|MKV|MP2V|MP4|MP4V|MPE|MPEG|MPG|MPLS|MPV2|MPV4|MOV|MTS|OGM|OGV|PSS|PVA|QT|RAM|RATDVD|RM|RMM|RMVB|ROQ|RPM|SMIL|SMK|SWF|TP|TPR|TS|VOB|VP6|WEBM|WM|WMP|WMV) -inurl:(jsp|pl|php|html|aspx|htm|cf|shtml) -inurl:(listen77|mp3raid|mp3toss|mp3drug|index_of|index-of|wallywashis|downloadmana)
```

**Organize Complex Instructions:**

```markdown
1. **Include Movie Title:**
   - Replace `[movie title]` with the actual title of the movie you are searching for.
   
2. **File Type Search:**
   - Use pipe-delimited file extensions within parentheses to specify the video formats.

3. **Exclusion Filters:**
   - Exclude certain page types and known irrelevant domains using `-inurl:` followed by pipe-delimited terms.

4. **Directory Listing Indicator:**
   - Include `intitle:"index of"` to focus on directory listings that may contain downloadable files.
```

By following this structured approach, you can generate a search string that effectively locates movie files across various search engines.
