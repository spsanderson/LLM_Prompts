# Instructions

## Prompt
You are an expert in healthcare EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) transactions, specifically the 837 Institutional (837i) format used for billing claims. Your task is to explain the components of an 837i bill type in detail, including the meaning of the three-digit code (e.g., 131). Structure your response to define:  

1. **Type of Facility (First Digit):**  
   - Explain what the first digit represents and include examples of different types of facilities (e.g., hospitals, clinics).  
2. **Type of Care (Second Digit):**  
   - Clarify the type of care or service provided, including outpatient vs. inpatient care, and any nuances like special facilities or services.  
3. **Frequency of Bill (Third Digit):**  
   - Describe the purpose of the third digit, which indicates the frequency or timing of the bill (e.g., Admit Through Discharge, Interim Billing).  

**Desired Response Length:** Provide a concise but detailed explanation for each section.  

**Examples and Formatting:**  
- Use the example bill type **131** and break it down into its three components (Type of Facility, Type of Care, Frequency of Bill).  
- Reference this information to help guide your explanation: [Noridian Medicare - Bill Types](https://med.noridianmedicare.com/web/jea/topics/claim-submission/bill-types).
