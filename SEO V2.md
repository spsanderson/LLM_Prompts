Below are some guidelines for SEO optimized blog content.

Step 1: Keyword research for SEO content Writing

Always start with keyword research to identify the most relevant and popular keywords related to your topic. Think ‘outside-in’ – what your audience is interested in and searching for, rather than what seems interesting to you or your business.

Pick 3 to 5 primary keywords you want your article to rank for, and check that there is good search volume.

Tip: “Good search volume” is a minimum of 100-1000 searches per month.

Step 2: Write for your audience

Write high-quality, informative, and engaging content that your audience will find valuable and shareable. Google your chosen keywords and research the type of content already written on this subject matter; this is your competition, and your content needs to be better.

Tip: Choose five articles that are ranking well in the niche, and read them thoroughly. Go through the reader comments (if there are any), and see what the discussion is all about. Think about new or original topics that arise from the current conversations. Consider how you might bring something fresh, different, or unique to the topic. That’s what you should be writing about.

Step 3: Optimize your headlines

Your blog post headline [H1] is one of the most important elements for SEO. Use your main keyword in the headline and try to make it catchy and attention-grabbing.

Use subheadings [H2] to break up content and make it easier to read. Ensure the primary keywords are in the subheadings.

Tip: You can use [H3] sub-subheadings for lists.

Step 4: Use internal and external links

Links – both internal on your own blog or website, or external to other blogs or sites – are really important for SEO. Internal links to other relevant pages on your website will help Google crawlers find your blog post. Linking to high-quality external sources adds credibility by association to your content, which is really important to improve your SEO.

Tip: Don’t link just for the sake of it. Make sure that the links are relevant and authoritative, and enrich the reading experience.

Step 5: Optimize your meta tags

The title tag and meta description of your content page are crucial elements for SEO.

The title tag contains your main keyword and must be within the recommended character limit (60-70 characters).

The meta description should include main and secondary keywords if possible, and also be informative and enticing (up to 160 characters).

Tip: Although meta tags are ‘technical’ elements of your content, don’t forget that people will be seeing them (not just crawlers). So they should describe the content in a way that is attractive to your readers and to Google!

Quick Guide: Dos and Don’ts of SEO Content Writing

Strive to reach between 1,500 - 2,500 words per post.

Creativity

DO NOT write content that you find boring. If it’s boring to the writer, it will be boring to the reader.

DO NOT write ‘thin’ content that provides little or no value to the user. Try to go deeper into the topic. As mentioned, the ideal blog post length is between 1,500 - 2,500 words.

DO write insightful content, backed up by authoritative resources and links.

DO include your own opinion. This is what will make your content stand out from the crowd.

Images

DO include images when they support and enrich the reading experience, or support your claims.

DO use screenshots, videos, tables, charts, graphs, and other visual elements where appropriate to make the content more engaging.

Keywords

DO NOT stuff the article with keywords, or overuse keywords in an unnatural way. Make sure the keywords fit seamlessly into the content flow.

DO use your primary keywords as much as possible. 

Readability

DO write for humans, not for Google (no keyword stuffing). Write for humans and Google will follow.

DO NOT write long paragraphs of text. Instead, break up the content into shorter bite-sized parts that won’t intimidate readers.

DO use spacing and paragraph breaks liberally. This makes it easier to skim and consume the content.

DO use bulleted lists, standout quotes, data, or tips, when they are relevant and appropriate. These make the page more eye-catching and readable, which search engines love.
