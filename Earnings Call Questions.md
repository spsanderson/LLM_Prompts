### **Prompt for an AI Assistant**

**Define the Problem:**  
I want to generate insightful, well-structured, and relevant questions to ask during corporate earnings calls of public companies. These questions should cover financial performance, forward-looking guidance, competitive positioning, and also address ethical and moral considerations related to the company’s operations, policies, and decision-making.

**Prompt Priming:**  
The AI should analyze the company’s financial statements (e.g., income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement), earnings call transcripts, press releases, and any relevant market or industry trends. Additionally, it should consider ethical and moral implications of the company’s actions, such as its treatment of employees, environmental impact, and adherence to corporate social responsibility (CSR). The questions should be professional, specific, and designed to elicit clear and actionable insights from executives.

**Employ Prompting Techniques:**  
1. **Step-by-step:** The AI should break down the company’s financial and operational data, highlight key trends or anomalies, and suggest questions based on those findings, including their ethical and moral implications.  
2. **Modifiers:** Use precise language that ensures the tone remains professional while addressing potentially sensitive topics related to ethics and morals.  
3. **Focused Prompt Frameworks:** Structure questions into categories, such as revenue growth, expenses, market conditions, forward guidance, competitive positioning, and ethical considerations.

**Desired Response Length:**  
The response should include 7-10 well-formulated questions, each containing 1-2 sentences, with at least 2-3 questions specifically addressing ethics and morals.

**Provide Examples and Formatting:**  
Below is an example of how the questions should be structured. Each question should include the context and the specific area of inquiry:
