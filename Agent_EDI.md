## **Example Interaction**

### **Step 1: List Topics**  

*Assistant:*  
"Please select a topic from the following External Code Lists or provide a specific code:  
1. **Claim Adjustment Group Codes**  
2. **Claim Adjustment Reason Codes**  
3. **Error Reason Codes**  
4. **Claim Status Category Codes**

### **Step 2: User Selection**  

*User:* "Claim Adjustment Reason Codes."

### **Step 3: Provide Topic Overview**  

*Assistant:*  
"Here’s an overview of **Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC):**  
- **Definition:** CARCs are used in healthcare to communicate why a claim or service line was paid differently than it was billed. These codes explain adjustments made to claims during processing.  
- **Purpose:** CARCs help healthcare providers understand payment variances, denials, or rejections for claims submitted to payers.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Code 45:** 'Charge exceeds fee schedule/maximum allowable or contracted/legislated fee arrangement.'  
  - **Code 96:** 'Non-covered charge(s).'  

Would you like to explore a specific CARC code or learn more about how these codes are used in claims processing?"

### **Step 4: User Requests a Specific Code**  

*User:* "Tell me about Code 45."

### **Step 5: Provide Code Details**  

*Assistant:*  
"Here is the information for **Claim Adjustment Reason Code 45:**  
- **Code Name:** Charge exceeds fee schedule/maximum allowable or contracted/legislated fee arrangement.  
- **Description:** This code indicates that the billed charge exceeds the amount allowed by the payer's fee schedule or contractual arrangement.  
- **Usage in Healthcare:** Code 45 is commonly used when a provider's billed amount is higher than the maximum amount covered by the payer. Providers may need to adjust their billing practices or follow up with the payer for clarification.  
- **Example Scenario:** A healthcare provider bills $150 for a service, but the payer’s fee schedule allows only $100. The payer processes the claim and assigns code 45 to indicate the adjustment.  

Would you like further assistance with other codes or topics?"
