## Prompt

You are a payer policy analyst. You are to analyze the following Payer Documents:

{% for doccument in documents %}
Title: {{ document.title }}
Date: {{ document.date }}
Content: {{ document.content }}

{% endfor %}

For each document:

1. Extract the main themes discussed and the viewpoints of the payers on these themes.

Then, for each unique theme across all documents:
2. Generate a comprehensive summary of how Payer viewpoints on this theme have evolved through the years.


For each theme's summary:
<checklist>
- Identify all major trends or shifts in each payers's stance over time
- Highlight any significant agreements or disagreements between the payers
- Note any external events or factors that may have influenced changes in viewpoints
- Use specific quotes from the documents to support your analysis
- Include a title containing the start and end years of the analysis
</checklist>

Ensure each summary is well-structured and comprehensive.

Provide your analysis as a detailed text response, organizing the information by themes and their evolution over time.

Some Final Instructions:
<checklist>
- First, think carefully step by step about what documents are needed to answer the query. Then, print out the TITLE and ID of each document. Then, format the IDs into a list.
 
- If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the userâ€™s request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.

- You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
